# HyperFactions Development Roadmap

> **This file has moved!** The roadmap is now split into multiple files for easier collaboration.

## Roadmap Location

All roadmap documentation is now located in the **[Roadmap/](Roadmap/)** directory:

| **[Roadmap/phase-a-commands.md](Roadmap/phase-a-commands.md)** | Phase A: Command System Overhaul |

| **[Roadmap/technical-reference.md](Roadmap/technical-reference.md)** | Technical constraints and patterns |

## Why Split?

The roadmap was split into multiple files to:
1. **Minimize merge conflicts** when multiple contributors are working on different sections
2. **Reduce context usage** for AI-assisted development
3. **Improve navigation** with focused, topic-specific documents
