# Changelog

All notable changes to HyperFactions will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

*No changes yet*

## [0.7.3] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed

- **Startup crash when GravestonePlugin is outdated**: `GravestoneIntegration.init()` threw `NoSuchMethodError` when an older Gravestones version was installed without the v2 API (`getInstance()`). Now catches `LinkageError` (covers both missing plugin and missing methods) so HyperFactions starts cleanly regardless of Gravestones version.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-02-11

### Added

**Integration Flags GUI Sub-Page**
- New Admin Zone Integration Flags page for configuring integration-specific zone flags
- Accessible via "Integration Flags" button in Zone Settings footer
- Shows `gravestone_access` flag with clear description: "When ON, non-owners can loot graves. Owners always can."
- Dedicated Reset to Defaults button (only clears integration flags, not all zone flags)
- Scalable layout for future integration flags
- Integration flags disabled with "(no plugin)" indicator when the required integration is not installed or not enabled, matching the existing "(mixin)" pattern for mixin-dependent flags

**Expanded Admin Integrations Command**
- `/f admin integrations` now shows all 7 integrations organized by category:
  - Permissions: HyperPerms, LuckPerms, VaultUnlocked
  - Protection: OrbisGuard API, OrbisGuard-Mixins, Gravestones
  - Placeholders: PlaceholderAPI, WiFlow PAPI
- `/f admin integration <name>` detail views for all integrations:
  - `hyperperms` — Provider chain, active providers, fallback config
  - `orbisguard` — API detection, claim conflict detection status
  - `mixins` — Mixin availability, individual hook load status
  - `papi` — Expansion registration, placeholder count
  - `wiflow` — WiFlow expansion status
  - `gravestones` — Existing detail view (unchanged)

### Fixed

- **GUI crash on promotion**: Players with the faction GUI open would crash when another player promoted/demoted a member, due to stale `ActivePageTracker` entries sending UI updates to dismissed pages. Added `onDismiss()` cleanup to all 8 pages that register with the tracker (members, dashboard, invites, relations, chat map, new player map, new player invites, admin zone map). `FactionChatPage` already handled this correctly.
- **World map empty after teleport**: Batch refresh was calling `WorldMapTracker.clear()` (nuclear wipe of all loaded tiles + ClearWorldMap packet) instead of `clearChunks()` (surgical invalidation of only changed chunks). After teleporting, the slow spiral iterator would get wiped on every batch cycle before it could finish loading. Now uses `clearChunks()` matching Hytale's own BuilderToolsPlugin pattern.
- **Placeholders not resolving for factionless players**: Both PlaceholderAPI and WiFlow expansions returned `null` for faction-specific placeholders when a player had no faction. WiFlow's parser treats `null` as "unknown placeholder" and preserves the raw text (e.g., `{factions_tag}` shown literally). Now returns empty string `""` for text placeholders and sensible defaults (`"0"`, `"false"`) for numeric/boolean ones.
- **Set Relation search interrupting typing**: The Set Relation modal opened a brand new page on every keystroke via `ValueChanged`, destroying the text field focus. Now uses partial `sendUpdate()` like the Faction Browser page to preserve focus during search.

**GravestonePlugin Integration**
> **Note**: The gravestone integration requires a new release of [GravestonePlugin](https://github.com/zurkubusiness/gravestones) that includes the v2 API with AccessChecker and events. This is pending review in [zurkubusiness/gravestones#2](https://github.com/zurkubusiness/gravestones/pull/2). Until that PR is merged and released, the integration will detect the plugin but the AccessChecker will not be registered.

- Reflection-based soft dependency on Zurku's GravestonePlugin for faction-aware gravestone protection
- New `GravestoneIntegration` class discovers running GravestonePlugin via Hytale's PluginManager
- Faction-aware access control for gravestone break and collection events:
  - Owner always has access to their own gravestone
  - Faction members can access gravestones in own territory (configurable)
  - Allies can access gravestones in allied territory (configurable)
  - Enemies/outsiders blocked from gravestones in claimed territory
  - Per-zone-type settings: SafeZone, WarZone, Wilderness each configurable independently
- Admin bypass and `hyperfactions.gravestone.bypass` permission support
- Death location announcements: faction members notified with coordinates when a member dies
- New `/f admin gravestone` command showing integration status, plugin detection, and config values
- New `config/gravestones.json` module config with 7 settings:
  - `protectInOwnTerritory`, `factionMembersCanAccess`, `alliesCanAccess`
  - `protectInSafeZone`, `protectInWarZone`, `protectInWilderness`
  - `announceDeathLocation`
- Gravestone block detection in `BlockBreakProtectionSystem` and `BlockUseProtectionSystem` (intercepts before normal protection)
- Startup banner shows GravestonePlugin detection status
- Debug logging for all gravestone access checks

### Changed

- Zone flag `gravestone_access` display name changed to "Others Loot Graves" for clarity
- Zone flag description updated to explicitly state owners always have access to their own gravestone
- Placeholder expansions (PAPI + WiFlow) now return empty strings/defaults for factionless players instead of `null`

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-08

### Added

**Faction & Alliance Chat Overhaul**
- New persistent chat history system with per-faction JSON storage and debounced disk writes
- Chat history GUI page with Faction/Ally tabs, scrollable message list, and send-from-GUI input bar

- Configurable chat formatting with colors and prefixes per channel in `config/chat.json`
- Ally tab merges messages from all allied factions into a chronological timeline with faction tag prefixes
- Automatic retention cleanup of old messages (configurable days and interval)
- Real-time GUI push: new messages appear instantly for all faction members with the chat page open
- Chat history pre-warming on player connect for instant page loads

**Dashboard Chat Mode Button**
- Replaced separate F-Chat and A-Chat buttons with a single unified "Chat Mode" toggle button
- Cycles through Public → Faction → Ally modes with color-coded labels
- Respects `chat.faction` and `chat.ally` permissions

**PlaceholderAPI Improvements**
- Refactored PAPI and WiFlow expansions for cleaner placeholder resolution
- Added `factions_home_pitch` placeholder (WiFlow)
- Both expansions now share consistent null handling and formatting

**CurseForge Description**
- Complete rewrite of the CurseForge listing page with comprehensive feature documentation
- Added emojis, colored accents, and marketing-friendly layout
- Detailed sections for protection system, zone flags, chat, announcements, GUI system, admin tools, and integrations
- Integration links for HyperPerms, LuckPerms, VaultUnlocked, Hyxin, OrbisGuard-Mixins, PlaceholderAPI, WiFlow
- Upcoming integration callouts for Ecotale, RPG Leveling, NPC Dialog, NPC Quests Maker, BetterScoreBoard

### Changed

- Chat command no longer supports one-shot `/f c <message>` send (use toggle mode instead)
- `ChatConfig` now includes a `factionChat` nested section for channel-specific settings
- `GuiManager` bumped Settings to order 7 and Help to order 8 to accommodate Chat at order 6

### Fixed

- Shadow JAR clobbering in multi-project builds: added `jar { archiveClassifier = 'plain' }` to prevent the plain jar task from overwriting the shadow JAR
- WorldMapConfig minor cleanup

### Docs

- New `docs/placeholders.md` with complete placeholder reference for PAPI and WiFlow (34+ placeholders)
- Updated `docs/integrations.md` with WiFlow expansion details
- Updated `docs/readme.md` with chat page entry

  - Bypass and limit permissions always require explicit grants regardless of this setting
- Configurable combat tag duration and settings
- Configurable power gain/loss settings

**GUI Map Improvements**

- Settings danger zone now inlined in template (visibility toggle) instead of dynamic append
- Settings container height increased from 620 to 680 for better content visibility

- War zone color on all GUI maps changed from red to purple (`#c084fc`) for visual clarity
- Admin zone map war zone colors updated to purple (bright and transparent variants)
- Pages accessible to non-faction players (Dashboard, Map, Browse) now show the new player nav bar (Browse, Create, Invites, Map, Help) instead of the faction nav bar
- Replaced `permissions.fallbackBehavior` string config ("allow"/"deny") with `permissions.allowWithoutPermissionMod` boolean (default: false)

### Fixed

**World Map Configuration**
- New `showFactionTags` option in worldmap.json to hide faction tags on the in-game world map while keeping faction color overlays visible
- New `refreshMode` option to control when world map tiles are regenerated:
  - `proximity` (default) - Only refreshes for players within range of claim changes. Best for most servers.
  - `incremental` - Refreshes specific chunks for all players. Good balance of performance and consistency.
  - `debounced` - Full map refresh after a quiet period (5s default). Use if incremental causes issues.
  - `immediate` - Full map refresh on every claim change. Original behavior, not recommended for busy servers.
  - `manual` - No automatic refresh. Use `/f admin map refresh` to update manually.
- Configurable batch intervals, chunk limits, and proximity radius (default: 32 chunks) per mode
- Auto-fallback option if reflection errors occur

**Configuration**
- Configurable message prefix via `messagePrefix` in config.json (default: "[HyperFactions]")

- Added `ZONE_PROTECTED` result to ClaimManager for proper error messaging

**Permission System**
- Fixed wildcard permission expansion: `hyperfactions.teleport.*` now properly grants `home`, `sethome`, `stuck`
- Fixed root wildcard: `hyperfactions.*` now grants all faction permissions
- `hyperfactions.use` no longer grants all user-level actions (now only grants `/f` command and GUI access)
- Fixed documentation: `fallbackBehavior` default is `"deny"`, not `"allow"`

### Changed

- ClaimManager now receives ZoneManager reference for zone protection checks
- PermissionManager checks category wildcards before falling back to defaults
- Updated help text to include `/f admin rollback` command

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-03

### Breaking Changes

**New Optional Dependencies for Full Protection**

HyperFactions now integrates with OrbisGuard-Mixins for enhanced protection coverage. While HyperFactions works without these, some zone protections require the mixin system:

- [Hyxin](https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/hyxin) - Mixin loader (enables protection hooks)
- [OrbisGuard-Mixins](https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/orbisguard-mixins) - F-key pickup, keep inventory, invincible items

**Installation for Hyxin + OrbisGuard-Mixins:**
1. Create an `earlyplugins/` folder in your server directory
2. Place Hyxin and OrbisGuard-Mixins JARs in `earlyplugins/` (NOT mods/)
3. Add `--accept-early-plugins` to your server start script:
   - Linux: `DEFAULT_ARGS="--accept-early-plugins --assets ../Assets.zip ..."`
   - Windows: `set DEFAULT_ARGS=--accept-early-plugins --assets ../Assets.zip ...`

**Additional Recommended Dependencies:**
- [HyperPerms](https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/hyperperms) - Permission-based limits for claims, power, and features
- [VaultUnlocked](https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/vaultunlocked) - Chat, economy, and permission compatibility with other mods

**New Zone Flags (some require mixins)**

New flags added that require OrbisGuard-Mixins to function:
- `item_pickup_manual` - F-key pickup blocking (requires mixin)
- `invincible_items` - Prevent durability loss (requires mixin)
- `keep_inventory` - Keep items on death (requires mixin)
- `npc_spawning` - NPC spawn control via mixin hook (requires mixin)

Native flags that work without mixins:
- `item_pickup` - Auto pickup (walking over items)
- `item_drop` - Item dropping from inventory

### Added

**OrbisGuard-Mixins Integration**
- New `OrbisMixinsIntegration` class for registering protection hooks

**New Zone Flags**
- `item_pickup_manual` - Control F-key pickup separately from auto pickup
- `invincible_items` - Prevent tool/armor durability loss in zones
- `keep_inventory` - Keep inventory on death in zones
- `npc_spawning` - Control NPC spawning via mixin hook
- Updated SafeZone defaults: auto pickup ON, manual pickup OFF, keep inventory ON, invincible items ON

- Chunk-based spawn suppression using the server's built-in suppression system
- 4 new zone flags for granular mob spawning control:
  - `mob_spawning` - Master toggle (false = block all mob spawning)

  - Changed from `new Teleport()` to `Teleport.createForPlayer()` for proper player head/body rotation setup
  - Fixed in all 7 teleport locations: TerritoryTickingSystem, HomeSubCommand, FactionSettingsPage, FactionSettingsTabsPage, FactionDashboardPage, FactionMainPage, AdminFactionsPage

**Message Formatting**
- Fixed garbled chat messages showing `Ã?Â§b[HyperFactions]Ã?Â§r` instead of proper colors

### Changed

- Removed unused `TeleportContext.java` class (replaced by `TeleportManager.TeleportDestination`)
- Refactored `TeleportManager.PendingTeleport` from record to class to support countdown state tracking
- `/f stuck` now uses generic `scheduleTeleport()` method instead of faction-specific teleport logic

## [0.5.1] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed

**Debug Toggle Persistence**
- Fixed debug categories not staying disabled after server restart
- Root cause: `applyToLogger()` was using `enabledByDefault || category` logic which re-enabled categories on load

- `enableAll()` and `disableAll()` now properly clear the enabledByDefault flag

**Debug Config Defaults**
- All debug categories now correctly default to `false` on first load
- Fixed `loadModuleSettings()` using field values as defaults instead of explicit `false`

## [0.4.3] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed

**In-Game World Map Not Showing Claims**
- Fixed world map claim overlays not appearing on production servers

### Migration Guide (from v0.1.0)

**Permission Node Changes**

If upgrading from v0.1.0, the permission system has been restructured. Individual permission nodes (e.g., `hyperfactions.create`, `hyperfactions.invite`) are now organized under category wildcards.

**Recommended Setup (HyperPerms commands):**

Grant full faction functionality to default group:
```
/hp group setperm default hyperfactions.use
/hp group setperm default hyperfactions.faction.*
/hp group setperm default hyperfactions.member.*
/hp group setperm default hyperfactions.territory.*
/hp group setperm default hyperfactions.teleport.*
/hp group setperm default hyperfactions.relation.*
/hp group setperm default hyperfactions.chat.*
/hp group setperm default hyperfactions.info.*
```

**Permission Categories:**

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `hyperfactions.use` | **Required** - Base permission to use `/f` command |
| `hyperfactions.faction.*` | Create, disband, rename, tag, color, open/close |
| `hyperfactions.member.*` | Invite, join, leave, kick, promote, demote, transfer |
| `hyperfactions.territory.*` | Claim, unclaim, overclaim, map |
| `hyperfactions.teleport.*` | Home, sethome, stuck |
| `hyperfactions.relation.*` | Ally, enemy, neutral, view relations |
| `hyperfactions.chat.*` | Faction chat, ally chat |
| `hyperfactions.info.*` | Info, list, who, power, members, logs, help |

**Note:** `hyperfactions.use` is required as the base permission to access the `/f` command. Category permissions control specific functionality. Admin, bypass, and limit permissions require explicit grants.
