# Phase B: GUI System Redesign

> **This file has been reorganized.** The content has been split into focused files for better navigation.

## New Location

**See [phase-b-gui/README.md](phase-b-gui/README.md)** for the complete Phase B documentation.

### Quick Links

| Section | File | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| B.0 | [hyperui-framework.md](phase-b-gui/hyperui-framework.md) | Design system, colors, typography, components |
| B.1 | [new-player-gui.md](phase-b-gui/new-player-gui.md) | GUI for players without a faction |
| B.2 | [faction-player-gui.md](phase-b-gui/faction-player-gui.md) | GUI for faction members |
| B.3 | [admin-gui.md](phase-b-gui/admin-gui.md) | Admin GUI for server administrators |

## Why This Was Split

The original file grew to ~2,200 lines covering:
- Design framework (~600 lines)
- Three distinct GUI types (~1,200 lines)
- Implementation tasks (~400 lines)

Splitting into focused files improves:
- **Navigation**: Find specific sections quickly
- **Editing**: Work on one GUI type without scrolling
- **Review**: Each file is self-contained with wireframes and specs
- **Maintenance**: Update implementation status in one place
